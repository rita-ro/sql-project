Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis
<pre> 
  Task 1.1 - Researching the details of online campaigns:
Calculated daily average, maximum, and minimum spend to identify budget allocation trends and detect outliers. 
Insights helped compare spending strategies across channels and highlight campaigns driving disproportionate costs. 
Google and Facebook both show large fluctuations in spend, but Facebook often has higher max values. Google shows some extreme peaks too. 
Many days show min spend = 0 while max spend is very high, some campaigns had no spend at all while others dominated.
This indicates budgets weren’t evenly distributed across campaigns/ad sets.
As a result I identified campaigns consuming disproportionate budget share.
Flagged days with zero spend or extreme spikes for further review. 
Enabled marketing team to optimize budget allocation and reduce wasted spend.

  Task 1.2 - ROMI perfomance analysis:
Evaluated advertising efficiency across Facebook and Google Ads by calculating Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) at the daily and channel level.
Calculated ROMI using campaign spend and value metrics. 
Identified top-performing days and channels with highest returns.
Top ROMI days are all Facebook campaigns, Facebook clearly outperformed Google in terms of efficiency (value generated per dollar spent).
ROMI values range 2.37 – 2.49, every $1 spent returned ~$2.40 in value.
Concentration in January–February 2022, the best results cluster in a short period, 
which may point to strong seasonality or a particularly effective campaign strategy during that time.
Optimization insight: strategies used in early 2022 Facebook campaigns could be benchmarked and replicated for future ads.

  Task 1.3 - Top performing weekly campaign:
Analyzed advertising campaigns across Facebook and Google to identify weekly revenue drivers.
Aggregated campaign performance by week.
Ranked campaigns by total weekly revenue contribution.
Highlighted standout campaigns for strategic review.
As a result, identified “Expansion” as the top campaign, generating $2.29M in the week of April 11, 2022.
Therefore I suggest to prioritize high-revenue campaigns in budget allocation.

  Task 1.4 - Monthly Reach Growth Analysis:
Measured audience reach growth across Facebook and Google campaigns to identify which campaigns expanded visibility most effectively.
Aggregated campaign reach by month.
Applied window functions to calculate month-over-month growth.
Ranked campaigns by highest reach growth.
The campaign “Hobbies” had the largest monthly reach increase.
In April 2022, it reached over 5M people, an increase of 4,27M people compared to the previous month.
This indicates a major expansion of visibility, likely due to a budget increase, new targeting strategy or viral success.
